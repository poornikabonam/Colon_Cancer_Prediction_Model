# Colon_Cancer_Prediction_Model
A machine learning solution to predict colon cancer types by combining clinical and pathological data. The project focuses on merging two unrelated datasets while maintaining data integrity and predictive accuracy.

# Data Analysis and Preprocessing
## Initial Dataset Overview
   - Two datasets containing clinical records of colon cancer patients were analyzed

   - Clinical Dataset: 300 records with clinical measurements and patient history
Pathological Dataset: 100 records with pathology results and risk factors

## Data Preprocessing Steps
### Categorical Variable Handling
Label encoding transformed categorical variables into numerical format for model processing. For example, 'Yes/No' responses in Family History became '1/0'.

### Missing Value Treatment
The unique approach involved class-based imputation, where missing values were filled based on the specific cancer type. This preserved the relationship between features and the target variable, resulting in more meaningful data.

### Outlier Analysis

The box plots revealed:
   - Age distribution varies across cancer types with minimal outliers
   - CEA Level showed significant outliers particularly in Type 2 cancer
   - Polyp Size maintained consistent range across types
   - Tumor Grade showed discrete value distribution

### Feature Analysis

The correlation matrix highlighted:
   - Strong correlations between pathological features
   - Weak correlations among clinical measurements
   - Independent nature of features between datasets

## Model Development
Why Random Forest?
   - Handling Complex Data
      - Effectively manages both numerical and categorical features
      - Robust to outliers and non-linear relationships
      - Handles missing values effectively

   - Feature Importance
     - Provides clear feature importance rankings
     - Helps understand key predictive factors
     - Guides future data collection priorities

   - Ensemble Advantage
     - Reduces overfitting through multiple decision trees
     - Improves generalization
     - Provides robust predictions
